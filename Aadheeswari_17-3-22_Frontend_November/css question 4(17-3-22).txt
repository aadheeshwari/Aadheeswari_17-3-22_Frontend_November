4)  What are Pseudo classes?



          Pseudo-classes select regular elements but under certain conditions like when the user is hovering over the link.

              => :link
              => :visited
              => :hover 
              => :active
              => :focus


FOR EXAMPLE:-

      a:hover {
	color: #FFOOFF;
       }
