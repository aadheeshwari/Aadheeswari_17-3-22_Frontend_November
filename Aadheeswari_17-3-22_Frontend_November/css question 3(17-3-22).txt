3)  What are Pseudo elements?
     

     Pseudo-elements allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ::after.

         => ::before
         => ::after
         => ::first-letter
         => ::first-line
         => ::selection

FOR EXAMPLE:-
          
       p: :first-line {
	color: #ffOOOO;
	font-variant: small-caps;
       }
